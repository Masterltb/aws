Throughout my internship at **Amazon Web Services** from **September 8, 2025**, to **November 28, 2025**, I had the valuable opportunity to apply theoretical knowledge to build and deploy a real-world project on the cloud platform.

I participated in the **"Cessation Support Platform"** project, through which I improved and developed a range of critical skills, including:
- **Backend Development:** Developed microservices using **Java (version 25)**, handling complex business logic such as progress tracking, user management, and assessment systems.
- **Cloud Architecture:** Designed and implemented infrastructure on **AWS**, utilizing core services like **EC2, S3, VPC, IAM, and RDS (PostgreSQL)**.
- **DevOps:** Built an automated CI/CD pipeline using **AWS CodePipeline**, which automated the build, test, and deployment process, minimizing manual errors.
- **Database Management:** Designed and managed a relational database (PostgreSQL) for user data and a non-relational database (MongoDB) for social features.
- **Analysis and Problem-Solving:** Analyzed requirements from the proposal, faced technical challenges (e.g., query optimization, complex business logic), and found suitable solutions.

Regarding my professional conduct, I always strove to complete assigned tasks well, adhered to team workflows, and actively communicated with colleagues to ensure the project progressed correctly.

To objectively reflect on my internship, I would like to self-evaluate based on the criteria below:

### Areas for Improvement

*   **Time Management:** Need to improve skills in estimating time for complex tasks to ensure more accurate timelines.
*   **In-depth Networking Knowledge:** Although I have worked with VPC, I need to learn more about advanced topics like peering, VPN, and Direct Connect to design more complex systems.
*   **Testing Skills:** Need to write more comprehensive tests (unit, integration) and automate them more effectively in the CI/CD pipeline.
*   **Non-Technical Communication:** Improve the ability to explain technical solutions to non-technical stakeholders in an easy-to-understand manner.
