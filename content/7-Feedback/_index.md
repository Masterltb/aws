### Overall Evaluation

**1. Working Environment**
The working environment is very friendly and open. FCJ members are always willing to help whenever I encounter difficulties, even outside working hours. The workspace is tidy and comfortable, helping me focus better.

**2. Support from Mentor / Team Admin**
The mentor provides very detailed guidance, explains clearly when I don’t understand, and always encourages me to ask questions. The mentor team supports the issues I encounter to facilitate my work. I highly appreciate that the mentor allows me to try and solve problems myself instead of just giving the answer.

**3. Relevance of Work to Academic Major**
The tasks I was assigned align well with the knowledge I learned at university, while also introducing me to new areas I had never encountered before. This allowed me to both strengthen my foundational knowledge and gain practical skills.

**4. Learning & Skill Development Opportunities**
During the internship, I learned many new skills such as using project management tools, teamwork skills, and professional communication in a corporate environment. The mentor also shared many real-world experiences that helped me better orient my career path.

**5. Company Culture & Team Spirit**
The company culture is very positive: everyone respects each other, works seriously, and everyone strives together and supports one another.

**6. Internship Policies / Benefits**
The company supports creating conditions for flexible time when necessary. In addition, having the opportunity to join internal training sessions is a big plus.

### Additional Questions
- **What did you find most satisfying during your internship?**
  The most satisfying part was the last four weeks when I had the opportunity to build a complete microservices system (`Program Service` and `Chat Service`) from scratch. Witnessing the complex business logic I designed—such as the Streak system and the Slip/Relapse mechanism—operate accurately was an incredibly satisfying feeling. It turned theoretical knowledge into a tangible, functional product.

- **What do you think the company should improve for future interns?**
  I think the internship program would be more effective if there were a structured training roadmap from the beginning, helping interns better understand the actual work of the company and their role in the project. Being guided specifically step-by-step, from workflows to how to implement actual tasks, would help interns integrate faster into the professional working environment.

  Additionally, having a clearer orientation on necessary DevOps skills, as well as an overview of the AWS services the company is using, would allow interns to easily build a solid foundation for long-term development. I also hope the program can provide documentation or a detailed competency framework to guide those who want to pursue a DevOps position in the future.

- **If recommending to a friend, would you suggest they intern here? Why?**
  Definitely. I would love to recommend it to my friends. This is not an internship where you only do menial tasks. You are entrusted with a real, challenging project and trusted to build it. The learning curve is steep, but the amount of practical experience you gain regarding cloud architecture, backend development, and professional software engineering processes is priceless. The dedicated support from the mentor creates a perfect environment for development.

### Suggestions & Expectations
- **Do you have any suggestions to improve the internship experience?**
  I suggest expanding the office scale so that more people have the opportunity to exchange directly with each other and experience working in an office environment more.

- **Would you like to continue this program in the future?**
  Yes, I am very interested in continuing with FCJ, whether through an internship program or otherwise. I feel a strong connection to the project I built and the infrastructure deployed on AWS. I am very excited about the possibility of developing it further, possibly implementing features like flow optimization or Video Call as mentioned in the initial proposal, to develop myself and learn more interesting things.

- **Any other comments (free sharing):**
  I am truly grateful for this opportunity. This internship was a pivotal moment in my professional development. It not only strengthened my technical skills but also gave me the confidence to face complex software engineering challenges in the real world. Thank you to the mentor and the entire team for guiding and supporting me.
